	<p>Among the many student associations of ParisTech,<strong> BEST is a leading example</strong> with its international character and its well-motivated members. Through all the events they organise in France, these students show their dynamism, their open minded spirit, their interest towards the international world, which are essential skills for a successful engineering career.</p>
	<p>With their cooperation, the French groups of BEST point out once more their skills and their willingness to organise great events such as the General Assembly of BEST. ParisTech is very proud of their joint representation to welcome these 250 students in France for a week.</p>
	<p>On behalf of ParisTech, I would like to congratulate these students for their involvement in the cooperation between students, universities and companies and express <strong>my support to the French BEST Groups for the organisation of the 2012 General Assembly.</strong></p>
